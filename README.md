This project presents Model Predictive Control as applied to self-balancing action to stabilize
and drive to the desired location. This project aims at Disaster management and Industrial warehouse
management, thus we incorporate a robotic arm into the design and in that attempt, we
aim to develop more robust, compact robots for warehouses. Autonomous navigation
with the aid of machine vision is also an area of research this project presents. The
application of SLAM(Simultaneous Localization And Mapping) algorithms to achieve
path planning and autonomous picking placement is also presented with extensive
research. Thus the research gaps of robustness and navigation in self-balancing robots
designed for disaster management and warehouse management are carried out in this
project.

## Abstract:
Natural calamities such as earthquakes, floods lead to frequent casualties. The two main effects are succumbing to the calamities themselves and the non-availability of aid during such events. For a timely supply of emergency aid, we propose a technology-driven solution with minimal or no human intervention, i.e. a robot designed to accomplish different tasks. Since these are rare events, during the off-calamity time the robot can be used for an Industrial environment. VIKRAM is a versatile robot that is equipped with a Model Predictive Controller to balance itself on two wheels to either move in an industrial warehouse or move on uneven terrain in case of disaster scenarios. To work in industrial warehouses and to aid medical assistance in disaster scenarios, it is mounted with a robotic arm that explores the capabilities of pick and place operation using advanced perception techniques. The VIKRAM robot can also autonomously navigate to its desired location either in an industrial environment using SLAM algorithms or disaster scenarios using an obstacle avoidance algorithm.
