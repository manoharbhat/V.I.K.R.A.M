# VIKRAM


This project presents Model Predictive Control as applied to self-balancing action to stabilize
and drive to the desired location. This project aims at Disaster management and Industrial warehouse
management, thus we incorporate a robotic arm into the design and in that attempt, we
aim to develop more robust, compact robots for warehouses. Autonomous navigation
with the aid of machine vision is also an area of research this project presents. The
application of SLAM(Simultaneous Localization And Mapping) algorithms to achieve
path planning and autonomous picking placement is also presented with extensive
research. Thus the research gaps of robustness and navigation in self-balancing robots
designed for disaster management and warehouse management are carried out in this
project.
